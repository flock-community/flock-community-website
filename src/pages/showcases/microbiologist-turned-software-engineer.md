#### Can you tell me about your background, Jerre? What did you do before joining Flock.?

I’ve worked at Flock for three years now. Before that I did a similar job at Capgemini for three years and four months. Similar, but in many ways different. After all, Capgemini is a large company and Flock. is relatively small. It was a deliberate choice.
