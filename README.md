## Build order

1. run `npm run build` to build using `gulp`.
2. run `npm run start` to build using `serve`.

## Gulp tasks

In the project directory, you can run:

### `gulp`

Executes the default gulp task which will clean the /dist/ folder and then create a new distribution with minimized html, js and css.

### `gulp html`, `gulp js`, `gulp css`, `gulp assets` and `gulp clean`

These are the tasks which are combined in the gulp default task. Can also be ran seperate.
